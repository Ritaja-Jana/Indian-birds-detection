# Indian Birds Detection

This project aims to classify emails as spam or not spam using machine learning techniques. The classification is based on the content and metadata of the email. The model used in this project is a **RandomForestClassifier** trained on the Spambase Dataset from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/94/spambase).

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ritaja-Jana/Email-Spam-Classification.git
